        <h2 id="ahpcrc">AHPCRC Summer Institute</h2>
        <p>
        I conducted research and studied at the <a href="http://ahpcrc.stanford.edu/">Army High Performance Computing Research Center</a> during the 2014 Summer Institute.
        During these eight weeks, I studied various topics in math, computer science, and engineering, including optimization, partial differential equations, and computational mesh generation.
        I also worked on research, developing real-time physics simulations on low-powered Android tablets (see the <a href="/projects/#physbam">Projects</a> page for more information).
        As part of this research, I developed a novel algorithm for distribution of points on a 3D triangulated mesh, following a provided UV density function.
        I received a verbal commendation on the excellence of my research report.

        <p>
        I worked with the <a href="http://lcmmun.org/">League of Creative Minds</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_United_Nations">Model UN</a> debate organization, from 2011&ndash;2014, both as a student and as a secretariat member.

        <p>
        As Undersecretary-General of Technology and Innovation, my work included audio/visual setup, networking, communications, and more.
        I developed Kiosk to fix some of the problems I saw arise (see the <a href="/projects/#kiosk">Projects</a> page for more information), and earned the Model Diplomat award for its creation.
        I also delivered scientific and technical presentations to students in preparation for debates.
        </p>
        <p>
        As a student, I was also Head Delegate for two years.
        I won the Best Delegate award at WEMUN 2011 in Beijing, and the Most Persuasive Delegate award at MUNOS 2011 in Seoul.
